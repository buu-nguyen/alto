# Target Configuration

Adding a new target to your project is **as simple as adding a new key** to the `targets` section of the `alto.toml` file. The key is a user defined name for the tap and the value is a dictionary of configuration options for that tap.

## Example Target Configuration

Here is a mock example of 2 target configurations, as you can see it can be quite concise:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="toml" label="TOML" default>

```toml title="alto.toml"
[default.targets.target-jsonl]
pip_url = "target-jsonl"
config.output = "@format output/{this.load_path}"
config.do_timestamp_file = true

[default.targets.target-parquet]
pip_url = "git+hhttps://github.com/estrategiahq/target-parquet.git#egg=target-parquet"
config.destination_path = "@format output/{this.load_path}"
config.file_size = 100000
config.compression_method = "snappy"
config.streams_in_separate_folder = true
config.add_record_metadata = true
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yaml" label="YAML">

```yaml title="alto.yaml"
default:
  targets:
    target-jsonl:
      pip_url: target-jsonl
      config:
        output: "@format output/{this.load_path}"
        do_timestamp_file: true
    target-parquet:
      pip_url: "git+https://github.com/estrategiahq/target-parquet.git#egg=target-parquet"
      config:
        destination_path: "@format output/{this.load_path}"
        file_size: 100000
        compression_method: snappy
        streams_in_separate_folder: true
        add_record_metadata: true
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="json" label="JSON">

```json title="alto.json"
{
  "default": {
    "targets": {
      "target-jsonl": {
        "pip_url": "target-jsonl",
        "config": {
          "output": "@format output/{this.load_path}",
          "do_timestamp_file": true
        }
      },
      "target-parquet": {
        "pip_url": "git+hhps://github.com/estrategiahq/target-parquet.git#egg=target-parquet",
        "config": {
          "destination_path": "@format output/{this.load_path}",
          "file_size": 100000,
          "compression_method": "snappy",
          "streams_in_separate_folder": true,
          "add_record_metadata": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Below, we will go over each of the configuration options for a target.

___

## Settings

### `pip_url`

The `pip_url` is the pip installable URL of the target. This is the same URL that you would use to install the target via `pip install`. This is the only required field for a target configuration.

:::tip Tip

Remember pip installable URLs can be a local path to a directory, tarball, zip file, or a git repo. Anything that can be used by `pip` can be used by `alto`.

:::

### `config`

This is the configuration for the target. This is exactly what you would put in the `config.json` if running the target manually. The only difference is that you can use the `@format` directive to reference environment variables and other config values via `this`. This is useful for sensitive information like passwords and API keys. Both the Meltano Hub and most github repos will tell you exactly what to put here.

### `executable` and `entrypoint`

By default, `alto` will assume that the target exposes a script named after the target key name in the alto config. For example, if the target is named `target-snowflake`, `alto` will assume that the target exposes a script named `target-snowflake`. If this is not the case, you can specify the `executable` explicitly. You can alternatively specify the `entrypoint` if the package does not expose a script or you want to use something other than the default.

:::tip Tip

Up until now, we have always used `target-name` as the name of our plugins. This is convenient because often it means we don't have to specifiy the `executable` however there is **nothing** stopping you from using a completely different name. You could call a target **prod_db** or **stg_db** or **local_csvs**. It doesn't matter. As long as you specify the `executable` or `entrypoint` correctly, `alto` will be able to run it. It also means commands might be more meaningful to you and your team.

IE, `alto pg_platform_data:sf_staging_db` may be more meaningful than `alto tap-postgres:target-snowflake`.

:::

### `environment`

The `environment` field is a dictionary of environment variables that will be set when running the target. It is fully scoped to the target and will not affect other processes.
