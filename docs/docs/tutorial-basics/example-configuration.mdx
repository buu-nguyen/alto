# Example Configuration


## What does a configuration file look like?

This section contains examples of `alto` configuration files. These examples are simply meant to help familiarize users. This is the exact configuration file that is generated when you run `alto init` and all represent exactly the same thing. The choice of format is down to user preference though we recommend `toml`. Once you understand the general structure, the next few sections will dive into the details of each field.


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="toml" label="TOML" default>

#### TOML

The advantage of `toml` is that it is a bit more compact than `yaml`. It is a **great** choice for smaller projects. It is also the only format that can colocate nested keys. This is useful for putting environment-specific `config` in the same place.

```toml title="alto.toml"
# Alto Starter Project

# Anything in the default section is applied to all environments
# you can have an arbitrary number of environments. The ALTO_ENV
# environment variable is used to determine which environment to
# layer over the default section.
[default]
project_name = "{project}"
# Enable builtin extensions or bring your own
extensions = ["evidence"]
load_path = "raw"
# Set env vars that will be available to all plugins
environment.STARTER_PROJECT = 1

[default.taps.tap-carbon-intensity] # https://gitlab.com/meltano/tap-carbon-intensity
pip_url = "git+https://gitlab.com/meltano/tap-carbon-intensity.git#egg=tap_carbon_intensity"
load_path = "carbon_intensity"
capabilities = ["state", "catalog"]
select = [
  "*.*",
  # PII hashing
  "~*.dnoregion"
]

[default.taps.tap-bls] # https://hub.meltano.com/extractors/tap-bls
pip_url = "git+https://github.com/frasermarlow/tap-bls#egg=tap_bls"
capabilities = ["state", "catalog"]
load_path = "bls"
select = ["JTU000000000000000JOR", "JTU000000000000000JOL"]
# Configuring the tap
config.startyear = "2019"
config.endyear = "2020"
config.calculations = "true"
config.annualaverage = "false"
config.aspects = "false"
config.disable_collection = "true"
config.update_state = "false"
config.series_list_file_location = "./series.json"

[default.targets.target-jsonl] # https://hub.meltano.com/loaders/target-singer-jsonl
pip_url = "target-jsonl==0.1.4"
# this.load_path is a reference to the load_path of the tap
config.destination_path = "@format output/{this.load_path}"

[default.utilities.dlt] # https://github.com/dlt-hub/dlt
pip_url = "python-dlt[duckdb]>=0.2.0a25"
environment.PEX_INHERIT_PATH = "fallback"

# Example of a custom environment
# This environment will be layered over the default section
# and will override any values that are the same in both sections.
# Dicts are merged, lists are appended. This would be active if
# the environment variable ALTO_ENV=github_actions
[github_actions]
load_path = "cicd"
targets.target-jsonl.config.destination_path = "@format /github/workspace/output/{this.load_path}"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yaml" label="YAML">

#### YAML

The advantage of using `yaml` is that it is the most ubiquitous format. Many users will already be familiar with it. While `toml` has the advantage of not requiring indentation, `yaml`'s indentation can prove a strength given larger configuration files.

```yaml title="alto.yaml"
# Alto Starter Project

# Anything in the default section is applied to all environments
# you can have an arbitrary number of environments. The ALTO_ENV
# environment variable is used to determine which environment to
# layer over the default section.

  project_name: "{project}"
  # Enable builtin extensions or bring your own
  extensions:
    - evidence
  load_path: raw
  environment:
    # Set env vars that will be available to all plugins
    STARTER_PROJECT: 1

github_actions:
  load_path: cicd

    target-jsonl:

<TabItem value="json" label="JSON">

#### JSON

The primary value in json is that is extremely common and easy to generate programmatically. Most languages can do this without third party libs. The `alto dump` command also produces json which alto iself can use.
